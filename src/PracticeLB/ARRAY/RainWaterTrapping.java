// Time Complexity: O(n).
// Only one traversal of the array is needed, So time Complexity is O(n).
// Space Complexity: O(n).
//Two extra arrays are needed each of size n.

// Approach: In the previous solution, to find the highest bar on the left and right, array traversal is needed which
// reduces the efficiency of the solution. To make this efficient one must pre-compute the highest bar on the left and
// right of every bar in linear time. Then use these pre-computed values to find the amount of water in every array
// element.

// Algorithm:
// Create two arrays left and right of size n. create a variable max_ = INT_MIN.

// Run one loop from start to end. In each iteration update max_ as max_ = max(max_, arr[i]) and also assign left[i] = max_

// Update max_ = INT_MIN.

// Run another loop from end to start. In each iteration update max_ as max_ = max(max_, arr[i]) and also assign right[i] = max_

// Traverse the array from start to end.

// The amount of water that will be stored in this column is min(a,b) â€“ array[i],(where a = left[i] and b = right[i])
// add this value to total amount of water stored

// Print the total amount of water stored.
